TAP TAP REVOLUTION is a simple yet addicting game that was inspired by DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION, Osu mania and other related rhythm games that involve tapping on notes which fall from the screen. The premise of the game is simple – tap the arrows at the right time as they fall into their slots. The falling 
arrows are randomized to fall in an unpredictable order and time.

Upon launching the game, the player is greeted with a start screen. Pressing button key 1 on 
the De1soc will begin the game. Once the game starts, the score of player will increment if 
player successfully pressed the arrow key corresponding to each of the falling arrow at the time 
of alignment. Different arrows will have different directions and colours.

A countdown on the bottom of the screen shows how much time is left in the game. Program 
will review player’s score/ amassed points in the end to classify performance.
